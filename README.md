## Sol Statz Frontend

This is the frontend repository for the Sol Statz project. It's built using Next.js, the ShadCN library, Tailwind CSS, and React Query.

We’re constantly working on improving our data pipelines, but at the time this repository was created, the data is included directly in the `aggregated-mev-data.ts` file. We're updating this data daily. We’ve already started working on moving everything to a separate, publicly available API.
